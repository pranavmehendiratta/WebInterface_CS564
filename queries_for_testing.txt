Checking if the queries are correct
1. SELECT COUNT(I.ItemID) FROM Items I WHERE I.Started > '2001-12-17 12:00:00'; ==> 1055
2. SELECT COUNT(I.ItemID) FROM Items I WHERE I.Ends < '2001-12-17 12:00:00' OR (I.Started <= '2001-12-17 12:00:00' AND I.Ends >= '2001-12-17 12:00:00' AND I.Number_of_Bids > 0 AND I.Buy_Price IS NOT NULL AND I.Buy_Price <= I.Currently); ==> 5902
3. SELECT COUNT(I.ItemID) FROM Items I WHERE I.Started <= '2001-12-17 12:00:00' AND I.Ends >= '2001-12-17 12:00:00' AND ((I.Buy_Price IS NULL) OR (I.Buy_Price IS NOT NULL AND I.Number_of_Bids = 0) OR (I.Number_of_Bids > f0 AND I.Buy_Price IS NOT NULL AND I.Buy_Price > I.Currently)); ==> 12575
